Back End Java Developer

Homework Problem

All candidates who are a fit for this role will be required to do a homework problem before any
interviews. This will be the basis for the first client interview. Your solution must be coded in
Java and use Spring Boot.


A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded
purchase.


A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point
for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).


Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points
earned for each customer per month and total.
